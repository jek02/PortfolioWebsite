                    <h2> Jake Marc Lucky M. Paraan</h2>
                    <p> “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying
                        to make you something else is the greatest
                        accomplishment.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson. This
                        quote hath brought a big impact in my life that
                        leads me to where I am today. Nowadays, Most of
                        the people are lack of self-confidence and afraid of
                        criticisms that they might encounter. Being a college
                        student, lowering your self-esteem and currently
                        experiencing stress and pressure is normal while on
                        the other hand it is not healthy for you as a student
                        and also a child in your family that carries different
                        responsibilities. Though I am friendly, kind, and joyful
                        person I also experience those kind of situations
                        which is very unfamiliar in a way that I always think
                        that I am the only one who is experiencing those
                        problems. I always rely on my friends (including
                        my internet friends), especially to those who are
                        transparent to me and those who are trustworthy.
                        Second is my family, not the whole family but just
                        some members of my family it’s because not all
                        of them can understand and relate in my situation.
                        Last is myself, because at the end of the day all I
                        have is just myself. I am Jake Marc Lucky M. Paraan,
                        19 years of age, and currently residing at Bucao
                        Manaoag, Pangasinan. I took this course for me to
                        explore and discover the world of technology and
                        the field of engineering. I love playing badminton,
                        volleyball, and online games. I am talented at singing
                        and passionate in dancing.
